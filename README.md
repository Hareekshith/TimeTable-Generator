# TimeTable Generator
This is a curious idea to generate the timetable for an educational institution.
This will generate timetable based on the number of faculty members, their subjects allotted, and the number of classes available. 
Meanwhile here are the checks to be completed!
### Tasks
- [ ] Figure out how data is gonna be collected on each faculty
- [ ] Figure out how data is gonna be collected on each class individually
- [x] Figure out how the timetable is gonna get generated
- [x] Figure out how timetable is gonna be generated on a bulk
- [ ] Make sure that timetable is equally weighed on each faculty
- [ ] Make sure suggestions are given promptly

### How I am proceeding: 
- Created a function to check whether any period is overlapping with the other classes
- Created a dictionary of all the subjects to store the allotted slots!
- Created a function that does generate a timetable whether no periods are overlapped!
